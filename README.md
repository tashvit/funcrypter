# Funcrypter - PyQt5

Basic encryptor/decryptor

Program generates random keys to encrypt messages.

Save your keys to decrypt your encrypted messages later. 

Select your saved key values and enter your encrypted message (numbers) to see the decrypted message.

## About

This program was created as a fun way to further implement ideas learned in the 
Mathematics for Computer Science program provided by the University of London - Coursera.

This two-way table provided in the course was used to convert letters into numbers before encrypting them.

Program uses a prime modulus as the basis of encryption.

This is not a secure method of encrypting messages as it is possible for anybody with the public keys to 
work out the decryption key and figure out the code.
